My role was to take the system from an initial concept to a fully-featured combat loop. This included everything from party controls and enemy AI to the unique 'Action Pass' initiative system."
            data-responsibilities="<li><strong>Scene & State Management:</strong> Architected the dynamic combat scene and managed game state persistence between the overworld and combat encounters.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Player Systems:</strong> Implemented the full player experience, including the party system, stat persistence, and the complete victory/defeat loop.</li>
            <li><strong>UI & Input:</strong> Revamped the combat UI and input logic from a designer's wireframe to create a more intuitive and responsive interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Gameplay Mechanics:</strong> Designed and scripted key mechanics like the 'Action Pass' turn order, a versatile status effect system, and controllable companions.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality-of-Life Features:</strong> Added a pre-attack damage preview, combat speed toggle, and a context-sensitive UI to clearly display player controls.</li>
            "
            data-learnings="
            <p>A key challenge arose late in development: a proposal to overhaul the input system for full mouse control. My investigation revealed this would require a total rewrite of the core 875-line combat manager, posing a major risk to the project's timeline.</p>
            <p>This became a crucial lesson in <strong>technical scoping and risk assessment</strong>. Instead of a high-risk rewrite, I made the pragmatic decision to refine the existing keyboard-centric system.</p><p>As a solution, I developed a context-aware UI that guides the player with the correct controls for each phase of combat. This ensured an accessible experience while keeping the project on track and demonstrated the importance of adapting design to technical constraints.</p>"

            data-learnings="
            <p>This project was a significant exercise in building multiple interconnected gameplay systems. A major challenge was ensuring the discrete systems I built, such as the shop, inventory, and stat managers, all communicated effectively to create a seamless player experience, especially after a major UI and level revamp mid-development.</p>
            <p>Working as one of two programmers taught me the importance of clear communication and task delegation. For instance, after building the initial inventory, the task and day systems were handled by my partner, allowing us to develop in parallel.</p>
            <p>Finally, I learned the importance of robust player data management. Debugging the 'Game Over' bug that failed to reset progress gave me a much deeper appreciation for building resilient save and state-management logic from the outset.</p>"

The game is a short, interactive prototype where you play as the long-suffering butler to the theatrical Pedro Paterno in late 19th-century Madrid. Your goal is to prevent his grand ambitions from collapsing into complete disgrace during a high-society ball."
            data-responsibilities="
              <li><strong>Programming (ChoiceScript):</strong> Rapidly prototyped the entire interactive experience, scripting the branching logic and state management. I implemented a stat-based choice system with over 15 variables to track player skills, story flags, and character relationships.</li>
              <li><strong>Narrative Design & Writing:</strong> As a newfound hobby for this project, I wrote a comedic script designed to reintroduce historical figures in a fresh, relatable way. The narrative focuses on player choice, humor, and crisis management.</li>
            "
            data-learnings="
              <p>This project was my answer to the question: How can I use my programming talent to make history engaging? It was a personal exploration into the intersection of coding and storytelling, inspired by José Rizal's own use of novels to influence public thought.</p><p>The goal wasn't to create a rigid history lesson, but to capture the spirit of an era through humor and player agency. It was a fantastic lesson in rapid prototyping, demonstrating how a choice-based narrative can bring historical themes to life in a way that is interactive and fun, rather than just informational.</p>

              <p>Frankly, this is the fastest that I have ever written a game, and will probably be the fastest for a long time unless I spontaneously decide to join a Game Jam.</p>

            data-overview="SFML Kong is a 2D arcade platformer developed for a university course. As one of two programmers on the team, my primary responsibility was building the core engine architecture from scratch in C++. I implemented the entire game state machine, the custom physics and collision systems, the UI, and the audio management."
            data-responsibilities="
              <li><strong>Engine & State Management:</strong> Architected the game's foundational structure in C++, implementing and managing all game states including the <strong>Main Menu</strong>, <strong>Game Scene</strong>, <strong>Pause Screen</strong>, and <strong>Results Screen</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Custom C++ Physics:</strong> Wrote the 2D platforming physics from the ground up, programming the complete <strong>map collision system</strong> and the initial, complex logic for <strong>player-ladder interactions</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Gameplay Systems & UI:</strong> Programmed key systems like the singleton-based <strong>ScoreManager</strong> and implemented the UI for all game scenes.</li>
              <li><strong>Audio Implementation:</strong> Handled the audio integration, implementing the <strong>background music</strong> and performing a complete <strong>revamp of the SFX Manager</strong>.</li>
            "
            data-learnings="
              <p>This project was a crucial, hands-on lesson in C++ game architecture. The most significant challenge was building a 2D platforming controller from scratch; systematically building the collision system from basic map interactions to complex ladder physics was an immense practical lesson in the nuances of low-level game programming.</p>
              
              <p>The project also highlighted the importance of proper environment setup. An early effort involved configuring the SFML environment and standardizing the screen size to create a stable foundation for feature development. As a collaborative project, it was also valuable experience in a team-based Git workflow, frequently merging feature branches to integrate my work on the core engine with my partner's work on gameplay elements.</p>
